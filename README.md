# JS Micro Challenges

## Assignment Objectives:

- Build fluency with creating functions to solve code challenges.
- Learn how to use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) to run [jest tests](https://jestjs.io/) in your terminal.

---

## Get Set Up for Success:

#### You're Gonna Need Node:

- Ensure that you have successfully installed Node on your computer.
  - Follow this [install guide](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/software-installs/blob/main/node-nvm.md)

#### Then:

- Fork and clone this repository.
- `cd` into it.
- Run `npm install` to install the library code that the automated tests rely on.
- Run `npm test` to verify that the automated test suites run.

---

## Instructions:

- Each `.js` file in this repo contains a single micro challenge.
- Start with `01-sum.js` and write code inside the `sum` function to meet the requirements of the micro challenge.
- To verify that your code works as required, you'll need to run the automated tests inside your terminal.
  - Do this with `npm test sum`.

## Important Note About the Tests:

If you want to run **all** of the test files:
* `npm test`

If you want to run a **single** test file:
* `npm test example`
* or
* `npm test sum`
* or
* `npm test compareTwoNumbers`
* or
* ...you get the idea, hopefully. ðŸ™‚
