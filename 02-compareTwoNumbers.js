// Create a function that takes in two numbers.

// If the first number is bigger than the second number, the function should
// return "The first number was bigger!"

// If the second number is bigger than the first number, the function should
// return "The second number was bigger!"

// If the numbers are the same, the function should return
// "The numbers are the same!"

// Examples:

// compareTwoNumbers(3, 2)
//     should evaluate to "The first number was bigger!" 

// compareTwoNumbers(2, 7)
//     should evaluate to "The second number was bigger!"

// compareTwoNumbers(7, 7);
//     should evaluate to "The numbers are the same!"
